<h2>Overview</h2>

<ul>
  <li>The API works by exchanging messages encoded in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON">JSON</a>.</li>
  <li>There are no fancy message formats, it's all just sending arbitrary JSON objects back and forth.</li>
  <li>There are some optional features like auto-generated documentation and validating requests with schemas, but you don't need to use them if you don't like.</li>
  <li>Building a lient cthat consumes the API is very straightforward. Also if you use Ruby, there is a helpful <a href="#api_client">client class</a> available.</li>
